In this study, we propose a task-based Modular-
ization system using various concepts of deep learning model.
The models include CNN for image classification and attention-
based large language models for text generation combined with
prompt tuning for aligned response. These models are integrated
into a loosely coupled system for scalability and maintainability
advantages. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our task-based
modularization approach in developing a robust and efficient
Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The code can be found here
